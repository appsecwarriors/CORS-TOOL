# CORS-TOOL
CORS Tool is designed to test and analyze Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configurations for web applications. CORS is a security mechanism that allows web browsers to control how resources are shared across different domains. Misconfigurations can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as unauthorized data access or cross-domain attacks
